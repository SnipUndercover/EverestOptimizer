# Loading time optimizer
This insanely complicated and complex mod has the sole goal to optimize the loading process of Everest to be up to 2147483647% faster. This means that Celeste will load so fast you may miss it if you blink your eyes for too long. As such, to be able to still enjoy the beautiful, gorgeous and magnificent splash screen (totally not biased) it is recommended you downgrade your PC specs.

Be warned that this speedup may come at a cost, as such, certain old hardware may even burn because it is running too fast.
I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE TO YOUR HARDWARE THIS MOD MAY CAUSE. USE AT OWN RISK.

Happy April fools!
